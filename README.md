# <ContinuousID_Pipeline>

## Description

This project helped me get familiar with setting up CI/CD.

Whenever im in a feature branch i can add it and push it to itself and have that go into the develop branch

From the develop branch I can merge that into the main branch and have it run some tests before allowing it to merge

Once merged into the main branch it will automatically redeploy to render

## Installation

npm i -y
npm run build
npm run seed
